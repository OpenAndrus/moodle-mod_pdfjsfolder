HEAD  -  Changed direct links to links with forced download flag
         set to make the choice one with known outcomes; either
         view a PDF in the browser or download it.

0.13  -  Added option for additional direct PDF links primarily for
         mobiles/tablets that PDF.js might not always work for due
         to limited memory and/or processor speed.

0.12  -  Beta release.
